								<h3 class="title">“Break the Language Great Wall” (RedClay): The Language Learning Application</h3>
								<p>Method: User Centered Design, Suervey, prototype<br>Developement: HTML/CSS/Javascript/PHP/MySQL</p>
								<p>There are more and more people moving to China for Chinese- learning. We applied the concept of “language partner” to build a language learning application for two groups of people – foreigners in China eager to discover their host language and culture and Chinese citizens willing to improve their foreign tongues. This language learning application is called “RedClay”. “Red” is the color of China and “clay” is a material used for the construction of the Great Wall. RedClay, as a mobile-web application, mainly provides social networking and learning functions (including cultural support and preference- based vocabulary lists) to help people who want to improve their foreign language abilities meet each other in real life.

								<p>Method: Experience sampling, Sentiment analysis, Interview</p>
								<p>Firstly, in the context of exercise, the current study explored the effects of online social network and wearable devices in the enhancement of Chinese females’ subjective well-being. An in-situ 2*2 experiment design was conducted. Result showed that online social network was significantly related to positive affects. Wearable devices didn’t show significance due to problems of accessibility. <br>Secondly, this study explored the potential linguistic variables that could predict Chinese females’ emotional well-being according to exercise-based online tweets. Regression model was applied to explore the relation between potential variables and participants’ self-reported emotional states. Positive additional activities and number of likes were two important variables that could be referred for further analysis.</p>
